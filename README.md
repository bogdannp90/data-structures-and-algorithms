## Introduction
This project contains various implementations of data structures and algorithms in C++. It includes sorting algorithms, dynamic lists, and solutions to various problems.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Radix Sort.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Operations on singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues. These data structures allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Placeholder for future graph algorithm implementations. Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graph theory, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.
- **Various Problems**: Solutions to quadratic equations, matrix multiplication, prime number checks, and base conversions. These problems cover a range of mathematical and computational challenges.
- **Search Algorithms**: Sequential and binary search implementations. These algorithms are used to find specific elements within a data structure.
