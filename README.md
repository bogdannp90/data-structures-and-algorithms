# Data Structures and Algorithms Program

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C++. It includes sorting algorithms, dynamic lists, graph algorithms, and solutions to various mathematical problems. The project is designed to help understand and practice fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Radix Sort.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Operations on singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Placeholder for future graph algorithm implementations.
- **Various Problems**: Solutions to quadratic equations, matrix multiplication, prime number checks, and base conversions.
- **Search Algorithms**: Sequential and binary search implementations.

## File Structure

- `include/`
  - `sortingAlgorithms.h`: Prototypes for sorting algorithms.
  - `dynamicLists.h`: Prototypes for dynamic list operations.
  - `inputValidation.h`: Prototypes for input validation functions.
  - `variousProblems.h`: Prototypes for various problem-solving functions.
  - `graphs.h`: Placeholder for graph algorithm prototypes.
- `src/`
  - `sortingAlgorithms.cpp`: Implementations of sorting algorithms.
  - `dynamicLists.cpp`: Implementations of dynamic list operations.
  - `inputValidation.cpp`: Implementations of input validation functions.
  - `variousProblems.cpp`: Implementations of various problem-solving functions.
  - `graphs.cpp`: Placeholder for graph algorithm implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (for building the project)
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., CLion, Visual Studio Code)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bogdannp90/data-structures-algorithms.git
   cd data-structures-algorithms
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

### Running the Program

After building the project, you can run the executable:

```sh
./data_structures_algorithms
```

### Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a main menu with the following options:

1. Various problems
2. Sorting algorithms
3. Dynamic lists
0. Exit program

Select an option by entering the corresponding number. Each submenu will guide you through the available operations and prompt for necessary inputs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
