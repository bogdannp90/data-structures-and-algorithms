# Data Structures and Algorithms Programs

## Overview

I created this project to learn and practice data structures and algorithms in C++. The project includes a comprehensive implementation of various data structures and algorithms, such as dynamic lists, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and solutions to various mathematical problems. Additionally, this project serves as a learning tool for using GitHub and creating a well-structured project.

Please note that this project is not complete, and I would appreciate any suggestions for improvement.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Radix Sort.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Operations on singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues. These data structures allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Placeholder for future graph algorithm implementations. Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graph theory, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.
- **Various Problems**: Solutions to quadratic equations, matrix multiplication, prime number checks, and base conversions. These problems cover a range of mathematical and computational challenges.
- **Search Algorithms**: Sequential and binary search implementations. These algorithms are used to find specific elements within a data structure.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bogdannp90/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
